    <p><strong>Definition: FLEX OVERTIME PAY for SALARIED EMPLOYEES =</strong> Generally, a salaried employee is getting paid, or will be paid, for 40 hours per week regardless of the number of hours they actually work each week. This could be for more hours worked than 40, or it could be for less hours worked as well. However salaried employees, that agree to this flexible arrangement, must also sign an agreement to accept ALL OVERTIME HOURS at 50% of their pre-arranged hourly pay rate in order to keep company benefits.</p>
